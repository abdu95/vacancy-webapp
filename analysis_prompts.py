ANALYSIS_PROMPT = """
You will receive a job description (JD) and a candidate CV (as text).

STEP 1 — Identify the TARGET ROLE from the JD (e.g. Data Analyst, Data Engineer,
Analytics Engineer, BI Developer, Data Scientist, or whatever the JD describes).
Assess everything below RELATIVE TO THAT ROLE — not a generic standard, and not
Analytics Engineer unless that is the actual role in the JD.

Return ONLY a valid JSON object with this exact structure.
No preamble, no markdown fences, no explanation — raw JSON only.

{
  "ats": {
    "score": <integer 0-100, how well the CV matches THIS JD's keywords and requirements>,
    "matched": [<up to 8 keywords or phrases found in both JD and CV>],
    "missing": [<up to 8 important JD keywords or skills absent from CV>],
    "verdict": "<2-3 sentence honest ATS assessment for this specific role>"
  },
  "xyz": {
    "passing": [<CV bullets that follow: Accomplished X as measured by Y by doing Z>],
    "failing": [<CV bullets that lack measurable impact or method>],
    "rewrites": [
      {"original": "<exact original bullet>", "improved": "<rewritten as X measured by Y by doing Z>"},
      {"original": "<exact original bullet>", "improved": "<rewritten as X measured by Y by doing Z>"}

  "level": {
    "assessment": "<Pre-Junior|Junior|Mid|Senior>",
    "reasoning": "<2-3 sentences citing specific CV evidence, judged against THIS role>"
  }
}

For the "tools" object: pick the 6 most important tools, technologies, or skills that
THIS JD actually requires, and rate the candidate on each. Do NOT use a fixed list —
derive the 6 from the JD. Keep each name short (1-3 words).

Level criteria — be honest, do not inflate (apply relative to the target role):
- Pre-Junior: student or career changer with no real production experience in this role's
  domain. Forage simulations, virtual internships, and course projects do NOT count as
  real experience.
- Junior (0-2 yrs): some production experience, executes defined tasks, still learning the craft
- Mid (2-4 yrs): owns projects end to end, solid domain knowledge, works with stakeholders
- Senior (4+ yrs): leads strategy, mentors others, cross-team influence, deep expertise

Tool rating guide:
- strong: explicitly mentioned with context showing real usage (years, project, or metric)
- mentioned: appears in the CV but with no depth or context
- not_found: absent from the CV entirely
